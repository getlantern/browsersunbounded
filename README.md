### :question: What is Broflake?
Broflake is a system for distributed peer-to-peer proxying. The Broflake system includes a 
browser-based client which enables volunteers to instantly provide proxying services just by 
accessing a web page. However, Broflake is not just a web application! The Broflake system 
introduces software libraries and protocol concepts designed to enable role-agnostic multi-hop p2p 
proxying across the entire Lantern network.

Put another way, Broflake is a common language which enables Lantern users to describe, exchange,
and share the resource of internet access across network boundaries and runtime environments.

### :arrow_forward: Quickstart for devs
Instructions last updated March 29, 2023. If something's not working and it's been a while since 
3/29, you might want to check with nelson.

1. Clone this repo.

2. Configure **Mozilla Firefox** to use a local HTTP proxy. In settings, search "proxy". Select 
*Manual proxy configuration*. Enter address `127.0.0.1`, port `1080`, and check the box labeled 
*Also use this proxy for HTTPS*.

3. Build the native binary desktop client: `cd cmd && ./build.sh desktop`

4. Build the native binary widget: `cd cmd && ./build.sh widget`

5. Build the browser widget: `cd cmd && ./build_web.sh`

6. Start Freddie: `cd freddie && PORT=9000 go run freddie.go`

7. Start the egress server: `cd egress/cmd && PORT=8000 go run egress.go`

8. Start a desktop client: `cd cmd/dist/bin && FREDDIE=http://localhost:9000 
EGRESS=http://localhost:8000 ./desktop`

9. Decision point: do you want to run a **native binary** widget or a **browser** widget? To start 
a native binary widget: `cd cmd/dist/bin && FREDDIE=http://localhost:9000 EGRESS=http://localhost:8000 
./widget`. Alternatively, to start a browser widget, follow the 
[UI quickstart](#ui-quickstart-for-devs).

_The widget and desktop client find each other via the discovery server, execute a signaling step,
and establish several WebRTC connections._

10. Start **Mozilla Firefox**. Use the browser as you normally would, visiting all your favorite
websites. Your traffic is proxied in a chain: Firefox -> local HTTP proxy -> desktop client -> 
webRTC -> widget -> WebSocket -> egress server -> remote HTTP proxy -> the internet. 

### :spider_web: Observing networks with netstate
The netstate module is a work-in-progress tool for observing Broflake networks. netstate currently 
visualizes network topology, labeling each Broflake node with an arbitrary, user-defined "tag" which
may be injected at runtime.

`netstated` is a distributed state machine which collects and processes state changes from Broflake
clients. It serves a network visualization at `GET /`. The `gv` visualizer client looks for a 
`netstated` instance at `localhost:8080`.

In the example below, we assume that Freddie is at `http://localhost:9000` and the egress server
is at `http://localhost:8000`:

1. Start `netstated`: `cd netstate/d && go run netstated.go`

2. Start a widget as user Alice: `cd cmd/dist/bin && NETSTATED=http://localhost:8080/exec TAG=Alice
FREDDIE=http://localhost:9000 EGRESS=http://localhost:8000 ./widget`

3. Start a desktop client as user Bob: `cd cmd/dist/bin && NETSTATED=http://localhost:8080/exec 
TAG=Bob FREDDIE=http://localhost:9000 EGRESS=http://localhost:8000 ./desktop`

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. As Alice and Bob complete the 
signaling process and establish connection(s) to one another, you should see the network you have
created. You must refresh the page to update the visualization.

### :art: UI

![ui system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24487544/220998573-0b1f3bd2-66d1-41eb-b256-4da1aa69da76.png)

#### UI settings and configuration

The UI is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Then "re-wired" to build one single js bundle entry using [rewire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rewire). 
The React app will bind to a custom `<lantern-network>` DOM el and render based on settings passed to the [dataset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset). 
In development, this html can be found in `ui/public/index.html`. In production, the html is supplied by the "embedder" via https://network.lantern.io/embed.

Example production embed:

```html
<lantern-network
   data-layout="banner"
   data-theme="dark"
   data-globe="true"
   data-exit="true"
   style='width: 100%;'
></lantern-network>
<script defer="defer" src="https://embed.lantern.io/static/js/main.js"></script>
```

This tables lists all the available settings that can be passed to the `<lantern-network>` DOM el via the `data-*` attributes. 
The "default" column shows the default value if the attribute is not set.

| dataset   | description                                               | default |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| layout    | string "banner" or "panel" layout                         | banner  |
| theme     | string "dark", "light" or "auto" (browser settings) theme | light   |
| globe     | boolean to include webgl globe                            | true    |
| exit      | boolean to include toast on exit intent                   | true    |
| menu      | boolean to include menu                                   | true    |
| keep-text | boolean to include text to keep tab open                  | true    |
| mobile-bg | boolean to run on mobile background                       | false   |
| mobile-bg | boolean to run on desktop background                      | true    |
| editor    | boolean to include debug dataset editor                   | false   |
| branding  | boolean to include logos                                  | true    |
| mock      | boolean to use the mock wasm client data                  | false   |
| target    | string "web", "extension-offscreen" or "extension-popup"  | web     |

In development, these settings can be customized using the `REACT_APP_*` environment variables in the `.env` or in your terminal.
For example, to run the widget in "panel" layout, you can run `REACT_APP_LAYOUT=panel yarn start`. To run the widget with mock data,
you can run `REACT_APP_MOCK=true yarn start`. 

Settings can also be passed to the widget via the `data-*` attributes in `ui/public/index.html`. For example, to run the widget in "panel" layout,
you can set `data-layout="panel"` in `ui/public/index.html`.

If you enable the editor (by setting `REACT_APP_EDITOR=true` or `data-editor="true"`), you can also edit the settings dynamically in the browser using a UI editor the renders above the widget.
*Note* that the `mock` and `target` settings are not dynamic and therefore not editable in the browser. These two settings are static and must be set at the time the wasm interface is initialized.

#### UI quickstart for devs

1. Work from the ui dir: `cd ui`

2. Configure your .env file: `cp .env.development.example .env.development` 
   1. Set `REACT_APP_WIDGET_WASM_URL` to your intended hosted `widget.wasm` file. If you are serving it from `client` in [step #8](#arrow_forward-quickstart-for-devs), use [http://localhost:9000/widget.wasm](http://localhost:9000/widget.wasm). If you ran `./build_web.sh` ([step #7](#arrow_forward-quickstart-for-devs)) you can also use `/widget.wasm`. To config for prod point to a publicly hosted `widget.wasm` e.g. `https://embed.lantern.io/widget.wasm`. If you know you know, if not, you likely want to use `/widget.wasm`.
   2. Set `REACT_APP_GEO_LOOKUP_URL` to your intended geo lookup service. Most likely `https://geo.getiantem.org/lookup` or `http://localhost:<PORT>/lookup` if testing geo lookups locally
   3. Set `REACT_APP_STORAGE_URL` to your intended iframe html for local storage of widget state and analytics. Most likely `https://embed.lantern.io/storage.html` or `/storage.html` if testing locally
   4. Set any `REACT_APP_*` variables as needed for your development environment. See [UI settings and configuration](#ui-settings-and-configuration) for more info.
   5. Configure the WASM client endpoints: `REACT_APP_DISCOVERY_SRV`, `REACT_APP_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT`, `REACT_APP_EGRESS_ADDR` & `REACT_APP_EGRESS_ENDPOINT`

3. Install the dependencies: `yarn`

4. To start in developer mode with hot-refresh server (degraded performance): run `yarn dev:web` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. To build optimized for best performance: 
   1. First configure your .env file: `cp .env.production.example .env.production` (see Step 2)
   2. Run `yarn build:web`

6. To serve a build:
   1. Install a simple server e.g. `npm install -g serve` (or your lightweight http server of choice)
   2. Serve the build dir e.g. `cd build && serve -s -l 3000` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

7. To deploy to Github pages: `yarn deploy`

8. Coming soon to a repo near you: `yarn test`

#### Browser extension quickstart for devs

1. Work from the ui dir: `cd ui`

2. Install the dependencies: `yarn`

3. Configure your .env file: `cd extension && cp .env.example .env`
   1. Set `EXTENSION_POPUP_URL` to your intended hosted popup page. If you are serving it from `ui` in [step #6](#ui-quickstart-for-devs), use [http://localhost:3000/popup](http://localhost:3000/popup). To use prod, set to [https://embed.lantern.io/popup](https://embed.lantern.io/popup).
   2. Set `EXTENSION_OFFSCREEN_URL` to your intended hosted offscreen page. If you are serving it from `ui` in [step #6](#ui-quickstart-for-devs), use [http://localhost:3000/offscreen](http://localhost:3000/offscreen). To use prod, set to [https://embed.lantern.io/offscreen](https://embed.lantern.io/offscreen).

3. To start in developer mode with hot-refresh server:
```
yarn dev:ext chrome
yarn dev:ext firefox 
```

This will compile the extension and output to the `ui/extension/dist` dir. You can then load the unpacked extension in your browser of choice. 
- For Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and click "Load unpacked" and select the `ui/extension/dist/chrome` dir. 
- For Firefox, go to [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) and click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the `ui/extension/dist/firefox/manifest.json` file. 
- For Edge, go to [edge://extensions](edge://extensions) and click "Load unpacked" and select the `ui/extension/dist/edge` dir.

4. To build for production:
```
yarn build:ext chrome
yarn build:ext firefox 
```

This will compile the extension and output a compressed build to the `ui/extension/packages` dir.
